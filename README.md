# Automatic Segmentation of Agricultural Plots With Artifitial Intelligence With Satelital Data

This repository contains the implementation of two algorithms and/or methodologies for the identification of agricultural parcels. One of them is based on the development and use of one of the best known edge detection algorithms: The Canny Algorithm. And the other one, the construction of a convolutional neural network in charge of learning the characteristics of the edges and segmenting the plots.

You can find the paper in which the work has been done in the following link, where, along with the complete research, you can find a step by step detail of how each of the implementations were built.

Similarly, to support the replication of the implementations, it is possible to find the [packages]() used together with their versions.

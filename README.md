# Automatic Segmentation of Agricultural Plots With Artifitial Intelligence With Satelital Data

This repository contains the implementation of two algorithms and/or methodologies for the identification of agricultural parcels. One of them is based on the development and use of one of the best known edge detection algorithms: The Canny Algorithm. And the other one, the construction of a convolutional neural network in charge of learning the characteristics of the edges and segmenting the plots.
